    <p>Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google[10] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.<br>[11] Go is 
   syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[5] and CSP-style concurrency[12] <br>The language is often 
referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.[13] </p>
